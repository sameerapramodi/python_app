Summary of Dockerâ€™s Role in Your Application:
Built a Docker image with your Python app and necessary environment.
Created and ran a container from the image, isolating your app and environment.
Ensured consistency across different machines and environments.
Executed your Python script (app.py) inside the container.
Printed output from the script to the terminal (information about the directory and files).
In essence, Docker helped you package and run your Python application in an isolated, reproducible environment that can be easily shared and deployed.
